# Vinay Nori 

My name is Vinay Nori and I graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC) with a Masters degree in Data Science, specializing in Machine Learning, and Data Analytics. During my graduate studies, I not only gained a deep understanding of data science fundamentals and programming skills but also worked as a Data Scientist for an insurance client by developing optimal filters using machine learning for predicting their future customers resulting in ~60% of their capital savings against 3rd party vendor bidding. Furthermore, I enhanced my Machine learning skills by designing an AI-enabled Fintech chatbot that teaches financial literacy to kids and was awarded first prize all over Canada by Fintech Cadence. I have a great passion for learning new technologies and am an AWS certified cloud practitioner and hold IBM Data Science Certifications. Previously, I worked as a Business Intelligence AxiomSL Developer at State Street Corporation which is the second-largest custodian bank in the world. During my tenure at State Street, I worked on improving workflow automation, compiled and reviewed financial data in support of data lineage, risk aggregation, audit functionalities and gauged the bank's operations for compliance with Federal regulations. I was awarded the best employee spot award for my contribution during the second quarter. Recently, I have joined Jarvis Consulting as a Data Engineer in pursuit of shaping my future and working with top financial employers in the world. I am working through a variety of projects relating to the use of Java8, Linux/Bash, RDBMS, Maven, Docker and more. I am an extremely eager and passionate individual looking for a position within an amazing team where I can apply my technical knowledge to solve real-world business problems, and I am always open to new opportunities.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VinayNori](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VinayNori)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VinayNori/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring agent that can be used to manage and monitor nodes/server hardware specifications. Created a PostgreSQL instance from a docker container running a CentOS7 image and activate a crontab to run a bash script to collect the data every minute and insert it into the database. Created a few SQL queries that the manager can use to check host failures on specific machines.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VinayNori/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a client-server architecture application using Java8 to allow the user to create, read, and delete tweets using the Twitter API, MVC design pattern and Java Spring framework. Tested the application using JUnit4 and Mockito to perform the unit and integration tests. Created a docker file to deploy an image to docker hub.
  - JDBC App: Implemented an application with DAO pattern with JDBC to model objects in a retailer database and perform CRUD operations using Java, Docker, and PostgreSQL for RDBMS.
  - Grep App: This app simulates the functionality of the Linux grep command using Java8 Stream API and Lambda expressions. It searches for a text pattern recursively through all the files in a given directory and outputs the matched lines to a designated file.
  
**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VinayNori/tree/master/springboot)]: Developed a Proof of Concept microservice trading application that allows users to manage profiles and accounts, monitor portfolio performance, and trade securities using Java8 and Springboot to implement the REST API coming from IEX Cloud to handle all the business and core logic of the application. It is tested using Junit4 integration tests and uses Docker to deploy and package application and push images(psql image and application image) to Docker Hub.


## Highlighted Projects
**Amazon Fine Food Review Analysis | Python, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing** [[GitHub](https://github.com/nori-vinay/Classification)]: This project predicts the sentimental score of new amazon food reviews to determine whether the review is positive/negative. Performed lemmatization, stemming, stop words removal using NLTK and text Vectorization on analyzing 568k reviews,256k users and 74k products along with evaluation of the classification algorithms for sentiment analysis.

**Facebook Friend Recommendation System Using Graph Mining | Python, Machine Learning, Graph Mining** [[GitHub](https://github.com/nori-vinay/facebook-friend-recommendation)]: Analysis of a person's Facebook followers and Prediction of missing links from given undirected graphs for new friend recommendations from the fakebooks recruiting challenge dataset.

**Artificial Intelligence Financial Literacy Chatbot | Python, Machine Learning, Rasa framework**: Developed an interactive chatbot that helps kids to save, invest and plan financial activities with parental, teacher and student modes of control. Designed and collected datasets for chatbots and performed training and validations using Rasa Architecture.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2021-present)**: Implemented multiple projects and applications that used a wide range of technologies including Java, RDBMS, Linux, Git, Docker and led a team of five using Agile scrum approach to daily meetings and ideologies. 

**Data Scientist Intern, Kelly Klee Insurance (04/2020 - 06/2020)**: Chose optimal filter conditions to identify the best potential customers before subsequently bidding on data from 3rd party vendors by saving ~60% capital expenditure. Charged with scrutinizing and pre-processing datasets consisting of >38M records in an Unstructured JSON format, efficiently applied Big-Query and Python with a Pandas library. As necessary, tweaked data classification imbalances using sampling techniques (SMOTE) analysis and employed resource fit criteria in supervised & unsupervised Machine Learning techniques. 

**Business Intelligence AXIOMSL DEVELOPER, State Street Corporation (07/2018 - 06/2019)**: Performed ETL and drill down functionalities for all Business reports. Utilized Autosys to schedule workflow automation. Compiled and reviewed financial data and gauged the bank's operations for compliance with Federal regulations. Improved workflow automation in support of data lineage, risk aggregation, validation, and audit functionality, to provide for disclosures in multiple formats.
