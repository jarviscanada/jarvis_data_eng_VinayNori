summary: "My name is Vinay Nori and I graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC) with a Masters degree in Data Science, specializing in Machine Learning, and Data Analytics. During my graduate studies, I not only gained a deep understanding of data science fundamentals and programming skills, but also worked as a Data Scientist for an insurance client by developing optimal filters using machine learning for predicting their future customers resulting in ~60% of their capital savings against 3rd party vendor bidding. Furthermore, I enhanced my Machine learning skills by designing an AI-enabled Fintech chatbot that teaches financial literacy to kids and was awarded first prize all over Canada by Fintech Cadence. I have a great passion for learning new technologies and am an AWS certified cloud practitioner and hold IBM Data Science Certifications. \n Previously, I worked as a Business Intelligence AxiomSL Developer at State Street Corporation which is the second-largest custodian bank in the world. During my tenure at State Street, I worked on improving workflow automation, compiled and reviewed financial data in support of data lineage, risk aggregation, audit functionalities and gauged the bank's operations for compliance with Federal regulations. I was awarded the best employee spot award for my contribution during the second quarter.\n Recently, I have joined Jarvis Consulting as a Data Engineer in pursuit of shaping my future and working with top financial employers in the world. I am working through a variety of projects relating to the use of Java8, Linux/Bash, RDBMS, Maven, Docker and more. I am an extremely eager and passionate individual looking for a position within an amazing team where I can apply my technical knowledge to solve real-world business problems, and I am always open to new opportunities."
